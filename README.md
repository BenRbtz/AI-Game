# AI-Game

This repo contains C# scripts I wrote for my Unity game.
The purpose of this game was to develop a game implementing AI behaviours in my second year.
To see the development process for this game, vist my blog at: eeu47d.wordpress.com

Some of the behaviours that I implemented are:  
- Seek
- Flee
- Follow
- Patrol

Other feature implemented:
- Procedurally generated enemies and rooms
- Finite state machine
- Playable person with moving animation
