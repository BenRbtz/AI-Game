# AI-Game

A game developed in Unity using C# scripts. 

The purpose of the game is to develop a game implementing AI behaviours in my second year.

Some of the behaviours that I implemented are:  
- Seek
- Flee
- Follow
- Patrol

Other feature implemented:
- Procedurally generated enemies and rooms
- Finite state machine
- Playable person with moving animation
