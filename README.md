# AI-Game

A game developed in Unity using C# scripts. 
The purpose of the game is to develop a game implementing AI behaviours in my second year.
To see the development process for this game, vist my blog at: eeu47d.wordpress.com

Some of the behaviours that I implemented are:  
- Seek
- Flee
- Follow
- Patrol

Other feature implemented:
- Procedurally generated enemies and rooms
- Finite state machine
- Playable person with moving animation
